                <h3>1. The score will be increased by clicking on the bubble which is as same as the HIT indicator shows.</h3>
                <h3>2. At every correct clicking on the bubbles, your score will be increased 10.
                </h3>
                <h3>3. If you click in a bubble which not contains exact number the hit indicator shows then you will get a error message and also your score will be decreased 10.</h3>
